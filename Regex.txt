检测语句：
插入：insert into table1(field1,field2) values(value1,value2)
删除：delete from table1 where 范围
更新：update table1 set field1=value1 where 范围
查找：select * from table1 where field1 like ’%value1%’ ---like的语法很精妙，查资料!
排序：select * from table1 order by field1,field2 [desc]
总数：select count as totalcount from table1
求和：select sum(field1) as sumvalue from table1
平均：select avg(field1) as avgvalue from table1
最大：select max(field1) as maxvalue from table1
最小：select min(field1) as minvalue from table1

Me: Are you ok?
Fr: I fine.
Co: Yes, I was here. you can find me now.
