Fine, I will found some thing. 
You and me will get this thing.
One day, I will be success.
When i am down and, oh my soul, some weary.
When troubles come and my heart burdened be
Then, I am still and wait here in the silence
Until you come and sit a while with me
You raise me up, so i can stand on mountains
You raise me up, to walk on storymy seas
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders
